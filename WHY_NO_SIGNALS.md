# Why No Signals Are Being Generated

## Current Status

✅ EA timer working - polling every 1.5s
✅ Sidecar running and scanning US100.e
✅ Symbol mapping updated
❌ **NO SIGNALS** - Sidecar has no historical data for US100.e

## Root Cause

The sidecar is trying to analyze US100.e but can't get historical price data because:

1. **MT5 is on Windows**, sidecar is on Ubuntu (no connection)
2. **US100.e is broker-specific** - free APIs don't have this symbol
3. **Sidecar needs data** to calculate features (RSI, EMA, etc.)
4. **Without data** → neutral features → no signals generated

## The Log Shows:

```
WARNING - Insufficient bars for US100.e, using neutral defaults
INFO - Testing US100.e/momentum_v3 with features: ema_slope=0.000000, roc_5=0.000000, rsi=50.00, bb_pos=0.500
INFO - Skipping US100.e/momentum_v3 - No signal generated by alpha
```

All features are 0.000000 or 50.00 (neutral) because there's no real data!

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use NAS100 for Analysis, Execute on US100.e (RECOMMENDED)

The sidecar analyzes "NAS100" using free data APIs (Yahoo Finance has NQ=F for NASDAQ futures), then the EA executes on "US100.e" (your broker's symbol).

**Changes needed:**
1. Sidecar config: `SYMBOLS=NAS100,XAUUSD,EURUSD` (for data collection)
2. EA config: `TradingSymbols=US100.e,XAUUSD,EURUSD` (for execution)
3. Add symbol mapping: NAS100 → US100.e in signal processing

**Pros:**
- Works immediately
- Uses free data sources
- No MT5 connection needed

**Cons:**
- Slight symbol name mismatch (but same underlying asset)

### Option 2: Connect Sidecar to Windows MT5

Set up MT5 connection from Ubuntu to Windows MT5.

**Changes needed:**
1. Install MT5 on Ubuntu (Wine) OR
2. Set up MT5 API bridge on Windows OR
3. Use MetaTrader Manager API

**Pros:**
- Direct broker data
- Exact symbol match

**Cons:**
- Complex setup
- Requires Windows MT5 to be always running
- Network latency

### Option 3: Use Only XAUUSD and EURUSD

Remove US100.e entirely and trade only Gold and EUR/USD (which have good free data).

**Changes needed:**
1. Sidecar: `SYMBOLS=XAUUSD,EURUSD`
2. EA: `TradingSymbols=XAUUSD,EURUSD`

**Pros:**
- Simple
- Works immediately
- Good data availability

**Cons:**
- Only 2 symbols (less diversification)

## Recommended Fix: Option 1

This is the fastest and most practical solution. The sidecar will:
1. Fetch NAS100 data from Yahoo Finance (NQ=F futures)
2. Analyze and generate signals for "NAS100"
3. EA receives signals, maps "NAS100" → "US100.e"
4. Executes trades on US100.e

The underlying asset is the same (NASDAQ 100 index), just different symbol names.

## Implementation

I'll implement Option 1 now - it requires:
1. Revert sidecar symbols to NAS100
2. Add symbol mapping in EA or signal API
3. Test signal generation
