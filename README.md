# 🚀 VPropTrader: The Super-Intelligent Autonomous Trading System

> **"Exponentially Better. Truly Autonomous. Risk-Proof."**

VPropTrader is not just a trading bot; it is a **next-generation quantitative trading ecosystem** designed to dominate Prop Firm challenges and manage capital with institutional-grade precision. It fuses **Macro-Economic Intelligence**, **Deep Quantitative Analysis**, and **State-of-the-Art Machine Learning** into a single, cohesive decision engine.

## 🧠 The "Super Intelligence" Core

VPropTrader operates on a multi-layered cognitive architecture:

### 1. 🌍 Macro-Fundamental Intelligence
*   **Real-Time Regime Detection**: Automatically identifies market states (Goldilocks, Reflation, Stagflation, Recession) using live data from **FRED** and **Yahoo Finance**.
*   **Yield Curve Analysis**: Monitors the 10Y-2Y spread for recession warnings.
*   **Inflation & VIX Guard**: Dynamically adjusts risk based on CPI data and Volatility Index levels.
*   **News Embargo**: Automatically pauses trading during high-impact news events.

### 2. 🔢 Deep Quantitative Strategies
*   **Fractal Geometry**: Uses **Hurst Exponent** to differentiate between trending and mean-reverting markets.
*   **Spectral Analysis**: Applies **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** to detect dominant market cycles and hidden frequencies.
*   **Statistical Arbitrage**: Monitors cointegration and correlation for pairs trading opportunities.

### 3. 🤖 Next-Gen Machine Learning
*   **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)**: A cutting-edge attention-based model for accurate time-series price forecasting.
*   **Reinforcement Learning (PPO)**: A Proximal Policy Optimization agent that manages active trades, optimizing for PnL while minimizing drawdown.

### 4. 🛡️ Institutional Risk Engine
*   **Prop Firm Guardian**: Strictly enforces **Max Daily Loss**, **Max Total Drawdown**, and **Trading Hours**.
*   **Dynamic Position Sizing**: Adjusts lot sizes based on volatility (ATR) and account equity.
*   **Capital Preservation**: The system's #1 priority is to **NEVER** breach a prop firm rule.

## 🖥️ The Cockpit (ElectronJS App)

Manage your empire from a sleek, modern dashboard:
*   **Configuration**: Easily set Prop Firm credentials and rules.
*   **Monitoring**: View real-time account status and risk metrics.
*   **Control**: Start/Stop the autonomous engine with a single click.

## 🧪 Verification & Testing

VPropTrader comes with an **Advanced Verification Suite** covering edge cases and failure modes:

```bash
# Run the Comprehensive System Test
pytest sidecar/tests/test_full_system.py

# Run Advanced Scenario Tests (Chaos Engineering)
pytest sidecar/tests/test_advanced_scenarios.py
```

**Verified Scenarios:**
*   ✅ API Outages & Data Failures
*   ✅ Extreme Market Conditions (Hyperinflation, Crashes)
*   ✅ Corrupted Data Handling (NaNs, Infs)
*   ✅ Race Conditions & Concurrency
